MYYENI Windows Setup (Placeholder)
=================================

Version: 0.1.0
Build: DEV

This is a placeholder file to enable the Download button on the MYYENI homepage.
Replace this file with your actual installer package (e.g., .exe, .msi, or .zip) when ready.

Recommended replacement steps:
1) Build your installer (Windows .exe/.msi or cross-platform .zip)
2) Place it here: public/apps/
3) Update links in app/page.tsx to point to the new filename if it differs
4) (Optional) Update public/apps/manifest.json to provide a friendly title and description

Changelog:
- 0.1.0: Initial placeholder uploaded

Notes:
- Files placed in the public/ directory are served statically by Next.js.
- A file at public/apps/<name> will be available at https://<your-domain>/apps/<name>
